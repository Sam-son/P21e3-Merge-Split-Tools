P21e3-Merge-Split-Tools
=======================
Included are three tools.

STEPMerge- Given a step file with references, finds all matching anchors and merges into a single file.

STEPSplit- Given a step file with assemblies, splits into proposed ZIP assembly form. Work In Progress.

PMISplit- Given a step file, uses ARM to split the workpieces into a separate file. This effectively puts all the geometry in one file and everything else in another.
