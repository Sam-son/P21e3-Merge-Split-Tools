//Classmap.h defines ARMCastLookupTable
//Because ARM_CAST macro doesn't work with templates, we need a way to get from a class name to the ARMCastTo.. for it.
//This is accomplished by doing a lookup in the map of the name of the class, whose value will be a function pointer to the proper ARMCastTo... function.
